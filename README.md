# Main Idea
Using one script tag by combining scripts together

What if we could use `require` or `import` just like we do in node to require dependencies.
Instead of relying on `window` global variable to require dependencies.

# Note
1. ignore copy files if `.js`.
2. import other js from `app.js` with `import ... from ...` statement.
3. multiple outputs are possible through multiple `entry` keys. `[name].bundle.js`.
